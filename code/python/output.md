Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind's long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the idea of forcing the waters

to do our bidding so fascinating. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind. Several giant dam

projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn't help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt's leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam. Turkey's bid

for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example, stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left -- all in return for a giant reservoir of

disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe,

Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam on

the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But Slovakia is

bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go-ahead to the even more wrong-headed

N armada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause hardship

for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but they are far

from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water

can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are possible

without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be either proper, or

scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don't need a dam to be saved.

Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you go in

America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether the productivity

revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.

The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing and

services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster than

the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity has increased by about 2% a year,

which is more than twice the 1978-87 average. The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due

to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a

revival in the underlying trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, a "disjunction"

between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the picture reflected by

the statistics.

Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace -- all that

re-engineering and downsizing -- are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an economy,

which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and machinery, new

technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of the changes that companies

make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing productivity:

switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much.

Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of recent

years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much less

widely than people suppose.

Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a rapidly

growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much "re-engineering" has been crude. In many cases, he

believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in cost. His colleague, Michael Beer,

says that far too many companies have applied re-engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping out

costs without giving sufficient thought to long-term profitability. BBDO's Al Rosenshine is blunter. He

dismisses a lot of the work of re-engineering consultants as mere rubbish -- "the worst sort of

ambulance chasing."

[A] not as good as it seems

[B] at its turning point

[A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle

[B] fall short of businessmen's anticipation

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo s

17th-century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake's harsh

remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics -­

but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked "anti-science" in several

books, notably Higher Superstition,

by Paul R. Gross, a biologist at the University of Virginia, and

Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon-Haunted World,

by Carl Sagan

of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as "The Flight from

Science and Reason," held in New York City in 1995, and "Science in the Age of (Mis) information,"

which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Anti-science clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science's

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the anti-science tag has been attached to many other

groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks of

smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, whose manifesto, published in 1995,

scorns science and longs for return to a pre-technological utopia. But surely that does not mean

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are anti-science, as an essay in US

News & World Report

last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question the

evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences of

industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the anti-science epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless.

"The term 'anti-science' can lump together too many, quite different things," notes Harvard University

philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti-Science.

"They have in common only

one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more enlightened."

[A] confrontation

[B] dissatisfaction

[C] separation

[D] contempt

[A] impartial

[B] subjective

[C] biased

[D] puzzling

[A] discuss the cause of the decline of science's power

[B] show the author's sympathy with scientists

[C] explain the way in which science develops

[D] exemplify the division of science and the humanities

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional

competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.

This development -- and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead -- has

enthroned the South as America's most densely populated region for the first time in the history of the

nation's head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people -- numerically the

third-largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent,

lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger numbers since World War II, and the

pattern still prevails.

Three sun-belt states -- Florida, Texas and California -- together had nearly 10 million more

people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and San

Antonio from 15th to 10th -- with Cleveland and Washington. D. C., dropping out of the top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say.

Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too -- and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday's

"baby boom" generation reached its child bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but newer

phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with more jobs but

with fewer people, too. Some instances-

•Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate -- 37. 1 percent since

1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

• Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53. 1 percent respectively.

Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western states with 7 .5

million people -- about 9 per square mile.

The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than

in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any other

state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of the

West. Often they chose -- and still are choosing -- somewhat colder climates such as Oregon, Idaho

and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden State.

As a result, California's growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent -- little more than

two thirds the 1960s' growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

-8 -23. Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census provided, America

in 1970s

---

[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history

[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population

[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth

[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II

24. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in that \_\_\_\_

[A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution

[B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants

[C] it reveals the Americans' new pursuit of spacious living

[D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday's "baby boom"

25. We can see from the available statistics that

---

[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US

[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West

[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration

[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population

26. The word "demographers" (Line 1, Paragraph 7) most probably means \_\_\_\_

[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy

[B] advocates of migration between states

[C] scientists engaged in the study of population

[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life

Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to

geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world's volcanoes, they are not always found at the

boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth's surface; on the contrary, many of them

lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases the

movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic

trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.

That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, are

moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The

complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are reminders of

where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates carrying these continents

has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another cannot readily be

translated into motion with respect to the earth's interior. It is not possible to determine whether both

continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is

drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring

instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the hot-spot population it appears that

the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 million years.

The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now appears

that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates across

the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material rising from deeper layers

creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops deep fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the

continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot initiates the formation of

a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots

may explain their mutability (inconstancy).

-10 -27. The author believes that ----

[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth's interior

[B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true

[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions

[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart

28. That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that \_\_\_\_

[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions

[B] they have been found to share certain geological features

[C] the African plate has been stable for 30 million years

[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe

29. The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining \_\_\_\_

[A] the structure of the African plates

[B] the revival of dead volcanoes

[C] the mobility of the continents

[D] the formation of new oceans

30. The passage is mainly about \_\_\_\_

[A] the features of volcanic activities

[B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates

[C] the significance of hot spots in geophysical studies

[D] the process of the formation of volcanoes

translation must be written clearly on the ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists had ever detected: a strip of

enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion light-years from earth. 3 1) But even more important, it was

the farthest that scientists had been able to look into the past, for what they were seeing were the

patterns and structures that existed 15 billion years ago. That was just about the moment that the

universe was born. What the researchers found was at once both amazing and expected: the US

National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cosmic Backgr ound Explorer satellite -- Cobe -- had

discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact begin with the primeval explosion that has

become known as the Big Bang (the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single

mass of energy).

32. The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required for the Big Bang, first put forward in

the 1920s, to maintain its reign as the dominant explanation of the cosmos. According to the theory,

the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, unimaginably dense knot of pure energy that flew

outward in all directions, emitting radiation as it went, condensing into particles and then into atoms of

gas. Over billions of years, the gas was compressed by gr avity into galaxies, stars, plants and

eventually, even humans.

Cobe is design ed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers would like to see much

smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local objects like clusters and superclusters of galaxies. They

shouldn't have long to wait. 33) Astrophysicists working with ground-based detectors at the South

Pole and balloon-borne instruments are closing in on such structures, and may report their findings

soon.

34. If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a triumph for yet another scientific idea, a

refinement of the Big Bang called the inflationary universe theory. Inflation says that very early on, the

universe expanded in size by more than a trillion trillion trillion trillion fold in much less than a second,

propelled by a sort of antigr avity. 35) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation is a scientifically plausible consequence of some respected ideas in elementary particle physics, and many

astrophysicists have been convinced for the better part of a decade that it is true.

It's a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat.

Light up the stove and you could bum down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to warn

of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the thinking

has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for their customers'

misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, compames responded by writing ever longer wammg labels, trying to

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn,

among other things, that you might-surprise!-fall off. The label on a child's Batman cape cautions

that the toy "does not enable user to fly".

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary-the dangers of drug interactions, for

example-and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn't clear that they actually protect

the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of the companies

lose when injured customers take them to court.

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts are

beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn't have

changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois, successfully fought a

lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt helmet.

"We're really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren't designed to prevent those kinds of

injuries, " says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the game, not the helmet, was the reason

for the athlete's injury. At the same time, the American Law Institute-a group of judges, lawyers, and

academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight-issued new guidelines for tort law

stating that companies need not warn customers of obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy

list of possible ones. "Important information can get buried in a sea of trivialities, " says a law

professor at Cornell Law School who helped draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal

community has its way, the information on products might actually be provided for the benefit of

customers and not as protection against legal liability.

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have started

to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business to business sales make sense

because business people typically know what product they're looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its reliability.

"Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier," says senior

analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by conducting online

transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the company's private

intranet.

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for

marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull" customers

into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that allow companies to

"push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing messages directly to targeted

customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a continually updated

stream of news and advertisements to subscribers' computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the

information they want to receive and proceed directly to a company's Web site. Companies such as

Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar technologies to push messages to customers about

special sales, product offerings, or other events. But push technology has earned the contempt of many

Web users. Online culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto the screen

comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the

distinction between the Web and television fades. That's a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to

make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon .corn, and other pioneers show that a Web

site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and security will

attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign

for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may well

wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of students'

career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of radical

educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this distinction-indeed,

contradiction-which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the

classroom.

An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education, justified

for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It is not simply to

raise everyone's job prospects that all children are legally required to attend school into their teens.

Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a character who is incomplete if he

cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by things outside of himself.

But this was not always the case; before it was legally required for all children to attend school until

a certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue this

kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all industrialized countries, we came to accept

that everyone is fit to be educated.

Computer-education advocates forsake this optimistic

notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between

educational and vocational reasons for bringing computers into schools, computered advocates often

emphasize the job prospects of graduates over their educational achievement.

There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. Many

European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to make sure children

are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, presumptuous to insist that

there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants.

Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of professional in a country as

large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many states and involves so many international

corporations.

But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go smce

well-developed skills, all other factors being equal, can be the difference between having a job and not.

Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a lifelong

acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer, that

is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take-at the very longest-a couple of

months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host of real skills

that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of course, that no

school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had cloned an

adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this unusual

animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not be used for such an

experiment-although no one had proposed to do so-and asked an independent panel of experts

chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 days with

recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group - the National Bioethics

Advisory Commission (NBAC)- has been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a

meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near final draft of their recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton ' s 90 day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended

indefinitely, and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of human

DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a crucial

question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for private funding to

be used for human cloning.

In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested

that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be "morally unacceptable to attempt to create

a human child by adult nuclear cloning." Shapiro explained during the meeting that the moral doubt

stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then informally accepted

several general conclusions, although some details have not been settled.

NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to clone

body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal funds

to create embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for research or to knowingly

endanger an embryo's life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.

NBAC members also indicated that they would appeal to privately funded researchers and clinics

not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go

further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human cloning. Shapiro and

most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone interview, he said this issue was

still "up in the air".

[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans.

[ B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning.

[ B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control.

[ C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning.

[ D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being.

[A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning.

[ B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research.

[ C] an embryo's life will not be endangered in embryo research.

[D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law.

26. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that \_\_\_\_

[A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely.

[ B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time.

[ C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC 's appeal .

[ D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled.

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of

the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity

through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of

people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion

of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn't they fall out of the sky? The fact that

the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking

himself about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was ready

for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don't have

unpredictable things, you don't have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing their cut and

dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.

In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that they

find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought. I've attended research conferences

where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a certain

experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said, "the data are still inconclusive."

"We know that," the men from the budget office have said, "but what do you think? Is it worthwhile

going on? What do you think we might expect?" The scientist has been shocked at having even been

asked to speculate.

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings.

He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but has

convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are planned and

carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is

perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents.

It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going

and how they will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash

register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard

pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is

management to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd balls" among researchers in favor of

more conventional thinkers who "work well with the team".

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your

translation must be written clearly on the ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)

31 ) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are historians, modem practice

most closely conforms to one that sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the significant

events of the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, each generation of historians

determines anew what is significant for it in the past. In this search the evidence found is always

incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial or partisan. The irony of the historian's craft is

that its practitioners always know that their efforts are but contributions to an unending process.

32 ) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external challenge to the validity of

history as an intellectual discipline and more from internal quarrels among historians themselves.

While history once revered its affinity to literature and philosophy, the emerging social sciences

seemed to afford greater opportunities for asking new questions and providing rewarding approaches

to an understanding of the past. Social science methodologies had to be adapted to a discipline

governed by the primacy of historical sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world.

33 ) During this transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by additional methodologies

designed to interpret the new forms of evidence in the historical study.

Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the historical profession. 34) There

is no agreement whether methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in general or to

the research techniques appropriate to the various branches of historical inquiry. Historians, especially

those so blinded by their research interests that they have been accused of "tunnel method," frequently

fall victim to the "technical fallacy." Also common in the natural sciences, the technicist fallacy

mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with certain parts of its technical implementation.

35. It applies equally to traditional historians who view history as only the external and internal

criticism of sources, and to social science historians who equate their activity with specific techniques.

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it

may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end

of the Second World War, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, giving its industries

unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world's best; its workers the most skilled.

America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose

economies the war had destroyed.

It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. Just as

inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found

themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries, such

as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was

only one American television maker left, Zenith. (Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South

Korea's LG Electronics in July.) Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic

market. America's machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as though the making

of semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer age,

was going to be the next casualty.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. They

began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes would therefore

shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into the causes of

America' s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with warnings about

the growing competition from overseas.

How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid growth

while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a

devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to blind pride. American

industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted," according

to Richard Cavanaugh, executive dean of Harvard' s Kennedy School of Government. "It makes me

proud to be an American just to see how our businesses are improving their productivity,"says Stephen

Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard

Business School believes that people will look back on this period as "a golden age of business

management in the United States."

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 females,

but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as

many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, boy babies

survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess of boys in

those crucial years when they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance for natural

selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving

depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death. Today it makes

almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes, one more agent of evolution has

gone.

There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few

people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few women have 15

children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of us have

roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between people and the opportunity for

natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is happening. The country

offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand

mediocrity of today - everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring - means that

natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes.

For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived.Strangely, it has

involved little physical change. No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the past 100,

000 years-even the past 100 years-our lives have been transformed but our bodies have not. We did

not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant

of evolution: they " look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly

beyond his comprehension. "No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond

comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia

we were, they will look just like us.

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its

advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem today, it

is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist poetry,

however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be -even admitting that the

theory on which it is based may be right-it can hardly be classed as Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says: for a century, past conditions of life have been

conditionally speeding up, till now we live in a world of noise and violence and speed.Consequently,

our feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change.

This speeding up of

life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we

want to interpret modem stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, unhampered by

stops, or qualifying adjectives, or finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words

that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same page, and

shorten or lengthen words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a

bridge off which they both fall into the river -and then to find that the line consists of the noise of

their falling and the weights of the officers: "Pluff1 Pluff1 A hundred and eighty-five kilograms."

This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as

Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great

change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is really this: have

we essentially changed?

Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony

are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the

traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as

their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young

people don't know where they should go next.

The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job

market have limited the opportunities of teen-agers who are already questioning the heavy personal

sacrifices involved in climbing Japan's rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey,

it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared

with 67 .2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed

dissatisfaction with their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed.

While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to

stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression. "Those things that do

not show up in the test scores-personality, ability, courage or humanity-are completely ignored,"

says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ' s education committee.

" Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild. " Last year Japan

experienced 2, 125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry,

many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year

Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal

reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened the

"Japanese morality of respect for parents."

But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles. "In Japan," says educator Yoko Muro,

"it 's never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can

endure. " With economic growth has come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan ' s 119 million

citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of

isolated, two-generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to

and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values weaken, the

discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that

of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly

one-quarter.

If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition-wealth, distinction, control over one'

s destiny-must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition 's behalf. If the tradition of

ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by

people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, however, it is

the educated who have claimed to have given up on ambition as an ideal. What is odd is that they have

perhaps most benefited from ambition - if not always their own then that of their parents and

grandparents. There is a heavy note of hyp ocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door after the horses

have escaped-with the educated themselves riding on them.

Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly. Summer

homes, European travel, BMWs-the locations, place names and name brands may change, but such

items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago.What has happened is that

people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they could, lest they be

thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine hyp ocritical spectacles, which

now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American materialism with a Southampton

summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the

journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in

private schools. For such people and many more perhaps not so exceptional, the proper formulation is,

"Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious."

The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few and

unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition as a

healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower than it

has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that people no longer

feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly professed.

Consequences follow from this, of course, some of which are that ambition is driven underground, or

made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid supporters,

and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to get on in life.

[A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices

[ B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power

[ C] its goals are spiritual rather than material

[ D] it is shared by the rich and the famous

Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare of their people depends

largely on the economic strength and wealth of the community. 31 ) Under modem conditions, this

requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists such as

economists and operational research experts. 32 ) Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of a

country's economy is directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this

in tum rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that governments

are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it

is utilized to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including

the setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure of education, or interfere in

order to reduce the wastage of natural resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may

cooperate directly in the growing number of international projects related to science, economics and

industry. In any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent on scientific advice and also

scientific and technological manpower of all kinds.

33. Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, people everywhere are

feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are often

forced to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given above. At the same time, the normal

rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at a vastly accelerated speed compared with

the past. For example, 34 )

in the early industrialized countries of Europe the process of

industrialization-with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed-was spread over

nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or

so. All this has the effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the community and

consequently presents serious problems for the governments concerned. 35) Additional social stresses

may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising from mass migration

movements-themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modem means of transport. As a result of

all these factors, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists

for planning the appropriate programs and putting them into effect.

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units，one man could continue to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science: exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word “amateur” does carry a connotation that the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way in British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so-called digital divide-the division of the

world into the info (information) rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife and

I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible then, however, were the

new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are reasons to be optimistic.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet becomes

more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access-after all, the

more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more governments, afraid their

countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two

billion people on the planet will he netted together. As a result, I now believe the digital divide will

narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news because the Internet may well

be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we’ve ever had.

Of course, the use of the Internet isn’t the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is not the

only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated

anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign investment

is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure（the basic structural

foundations of a society）in the United States. When the United States built its industrial infrastructure,

it didn’t have the capital to do so. And that is why America’s Second Wave infrastructure-including

roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on-were built with foreign investment. The English, the

Germans, the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain’s former colony. They financed them.

Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The Americans. I believe the same

thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you

have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the

better off you’re going to be. That doesn't mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign

corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how important they can be in building the

energy and telecom infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society of

Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deep into a long

self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and

spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of headscratching puzzlement about what in the

world those readers really want.

But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of

standard templates (patterns) into which they plug each day’s events. In other words, there is a

conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative

structure for otherwise confusions news.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers which helps

explain why the “standard templates”of the newsroom seem alien many readers. In a recent survey,

questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle size cities around the country, plus one large

metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale

neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they’re less likely to go to church,

do volunteer work, or put down roots in community.

Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to

reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn’t rooted in

inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their

questions.

readers.

This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled

business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots

of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed and

fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that

so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now

focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values,

education, and class.

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: "Won't the wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?"

There's no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy.

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting customers' demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity grows, the world's wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil trust was broken up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing-witness Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan-but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise, regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won't multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of “defending competition” on issues that affect many other nations, as in the U S. vs. Microsoft case ?

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a

part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional

progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a

disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming “I wanted to spend more time with my

family”.

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the Americans

term “downshifting”has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been transformed from

a passionate advocate of the philosophy of “having it all”, preached by Linda Kelsey for the past

seven years in the pages of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything.

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the

editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of “juggling your life”, and

making the alternative move into “downshifting” brings with it far greater rewards than financial

success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey used to

advocate and I once enjoyed: 12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office

politics and the limitations of being a parent on “quality time”.

In America,

the move away from juggling to a simpler,

less materialistic lifestyle is a

well-established trend. Downshifting-also known in America as “voluntary simplicity” has, ironically,

even bred a new area of what might be termed anticonsumerism. There are a number of bestselling

downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are newsletter's, such

as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of Americans useful tips on anything from

recycling their cling-film to making their own soap; there are even support groups for those who want

to achieve the mid- '90s equivalent of dropping out.

While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic decline — after the mass

redundancies caused by downsizing in the late’80s — and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in

Britain, at least among the middle-class downshifters of my acquaintance, we have different reasons

for seeking to simplify our lives.

For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the’80s, downshifting

in the mid-'90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life — growing your own organic

vegetables, and risking turning into one—as a personal recognition of your limitations.

In less than 30 years’ time the Star Trek holodeck will be a reality. Direct links between the brain’s nervous system and a computer will also create full sensory virtual environments, allowing virtual vacations like those in the film Total Recall.

41）There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars with pollution monitors that will disable them when they offend. 42）Children will play with dolls equipped with personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be regarded as workmates rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of smell television, and digital age will have arrived.

According to BT’s futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the developments scheduled for the first few decades of the new millennium （ a period of 1,000 years ） , when supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all areas of life.

43）Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest developments will be in medicine, including an extended life expectancy and dozens of artificial organs coming into use between now and 2040.

Pearson also predicts a breakthrough in computer-human links. “By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, rather like the holidays in Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck, ” he says. 44）But that, Pearson points out, is only the start of man-machine integration: “It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century.”

Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible. But he does expect social problems as a result of technological advances. A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example, cause problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots will mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human friends and the droids. 45）And home appliances will also become so smart that controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new psychological disorder—kitchen rage.

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify

shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to

show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with

their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you

are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries;

alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because

the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around

by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on.

Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is

suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and

stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?” the new arrival asked St. Peter.

“Oh, that’s God,”

came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor.”

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the

experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make a

passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties. With other

audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging

remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats

like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include

a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced

manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that

a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first

you don’t succeed, give up” or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and

understatement. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you can turn about and

inject with humor.

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with

work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in

robotics—the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have yet

to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we

barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the

rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with

mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers.

And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already

robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy—

far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less

human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves—goals that pose a real

challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery, manager

of a robotics program at NASA, “we can't yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact

with a dynamic world.”

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell of

initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors

might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to

extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain's roughly one hundred

billion nerve cells are much more talented — and human perception far more complicated — than

previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a machine panel by a

fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly

changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing

on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The

most advanced computer systems on Earth can't approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still

don’t know quite how we do it.

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about

to return? Since OPEC agreed to

supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10

last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when

prices quadrupled, and 1979-1980, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in

double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and

doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push

the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in the

1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol

than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite

big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in

the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy,

energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile

telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich

economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest Economic

Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would

increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter

of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—to which

heavy industry has shifted — have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously

squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it

has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess

demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The Economist’s

commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by

70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for

how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect”, a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects — a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to control

terminally ill patients’pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient medication to control their pain if that might hasten death”.

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery,” he says. “We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide.”

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering”, to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse”. He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear...that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension”.

-9 -36. From the first three paragraphs, we learn that

.

[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’pain

[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives

[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide

[D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide

37. Which of the following statements its true according to the text?

[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients’death.

[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.

[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.

[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.

38. According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is

.

[A] prolonged medical procedures

[B] inadequate treatment of pain

[C] systematic drug abuse

[D] insufficient hospital care

[A] Bold.

[B] Harmful.

[C] Careless.

[D] Desperate

Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical

and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of behavior, but we have been slow to

develop the science from which such a technology might be drawn.（41）One difficulty is that almost

all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of

character, human nature, and so on. Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced

only when they discarded them. （ 42 ） The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly

because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of

explanations have been hard to find. The environment is obviously important, but its role has remained

obscure. It does not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover and analyze.（43）

The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago,

and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is

only beginning to be recognized and studied. As the interaction between organism and environment

has come to be understood, however, effects once assigned to states of mind, feelings, and traits are

beginning to be traced to accessible conditions, and a technology of behavior may therefore become

available. It will not solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific views, and

these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty. （ 44 ） They are the

possessions of the autonomous（self-governing）man of traditional theory, and they are essential to

practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements. A

scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the achievement to the environment. It also raises

questions concerning “values”. Who will use a technology and to what ends? （45）Until these issues

are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to

solve our problems.

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Inter net. The American spymaster who built the Office

of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with

information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the "great game" of espionage

-spying as a "profession." These days the Net, which has already re-made such everyday pastimes as

buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan 's vocation as well.

The latest revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen's e-mail. That

kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the World

Wide Web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it "open

source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. In 1995 the CIA

held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large margin,

was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of

the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc., a private

intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of

spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm McDermott

International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.Straitford.com.

Straiford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually

reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster's dream. Last week his

firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far comers of the world and predicting a crisis in

Ukraine. "As soon as that report runs, we'll suddenly get 500 new internet sign-ups from Ukraine,"

says Friedman, a former political science professor. "And we'll hear back from some of them."

Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good information

from bad. That's where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 m Austin. Several of his staff members have

military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm's outsider status as the key to its success.

Straitford's briefs don't sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies avoid

dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes

pride in its independent voice.

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, "all that is needed for the triumph of a

misguided cause is that good people do nothing." One such cause now seeks to end biomedical

research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in research. Scientists need

to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and

thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights movement

target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people understand the

process of health care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are

perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was

distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in

animals-no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if

vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, "Then I would have to

say yes." Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, "Don't worry, scientists will find

some way of using computers." Such well-meaning people just don't understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable way-in

human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between

animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a father's bypass operation, a baby's

vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to

produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at

best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could "adopt" middle school classes and present their own research.

They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation go

unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be opened to

tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders

are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known

personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal

research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility

that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems,

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads accounted for

under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of mergers is

completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved by major rail

earners.

them by the throat.

Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost

reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce

competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities traveling long

distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads therefore have

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only one

rail company. Railroads typically charge such " captive" shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they do

when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being overcharged

have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but

the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long run it

reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, shippers

who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so, leaving

remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many economists

subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will

flourish and which will fail. "Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses

in the marketplace?"asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a round of huge rate increases. The

railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes, still does not earn enough to

cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet railroads continue to

borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion

bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's net railway operating income

in 1996 was just $427 million, less than half of the carrying costs of the transaction. Who's going to

pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX

increase their grip on the market.

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional. Small

wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips can be

replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure. Such

advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50

years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death-and our failure to confront that

reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem

to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can

possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care.

Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient-too

often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In 1950, the US spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion.

Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars

conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that

sustains life beyond a certain age-say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been

quoted as saying that the old and infirm "have a duty to die and get out of the way", so that younger,

healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and

remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53.

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon general C. Everett

Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention works and

that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to

age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As a physician, I know the most

costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and

Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we

have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on

humbler therapies that could improve people's lives.

- 9 -36. What is implied in the first sentence?

[A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people.

Human beings in all times and places think about their world and wonder at their place in it.

Humans are thoughtful and creative, possessed of insatiable curiosity. ( 4 1 ) Furthermore, humans have

the ability to modify the environment in which they live, thus subjecting all other life forms to their

own peculiar ideas and fancies. Therefore, it is important to study humans in all their richness and

diversity in a calm and systematic manner, with the hope that the knowledge resulting from such

studies can lead humans to a more harmonious way of living with themselves and with all other life

forms on this planet Earth.

"Anthropology" derives from the Greek words anthropos "human" and logos "the study of." By

its very name, anthropology encompasses the study of all humankind.

Anthropology is one of the social sciences. ( 42) Social science is that branch of intellectual

enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors in the same reasoned, orderly, systematic,

and dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of natural phenomena.

Social science disciplines include geography, economics, political, science, psychology, and

sociology. Each of these social sciences has a subfield or specialization which lies particularly close to

anthropology.

All the social sciences focus upon the study of humanity. Anthropology is a field-study oriented

discipline which makes extensive use of the comparative method in analysis. ( 43 ) The emphasis on

data gathered first-hand, combined with a cross-cultural perspective brought to the analysis of cultures

past and present, makes this study a unique and distinctly important social science.

Anthropological analyses rest heavily upon the concept of culture. Sir Edward Tylor's

formulation of the concept of culture was one of the great intellectual achievements of 19th century

science. ( 44) Tylor defined culture as " ... that complex whole which includes belief, art, morals, law,

custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society." This insight,

so profound in its simplicity, opened up an entirely new way of perceiving and understanding human

life. Implicit within Tylor's definition is the concept that culture is learned. shared, and patterned

behavior.

( 45 ) Thus, the anthropological concept of "culture," like the concept of "set" in mathematics, is an

abstract concept which makes possible immense amounts of concrete research and understanding.

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job

database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site's "personal search

agent". It's an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title, and salary,

then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords

legal, intellectual property and Washington, D. C. Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an

opening. "I struck gold," says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position

as in-house counsel for a company.

With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding prom1smg openmgs can he

time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But

although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your criteria,

for example, may work against you: "Every time you answer a question you eliminate a possibility,"

says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept-what you think you want to

do-then broaden it. "None of these programs do that," says another expert. "There's no career

counseling implicit in all of this." Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to

keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the

database again. "I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a database that

might interest me," says the author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite's agent sends out

messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential

jobs-those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; job hunters will

have to visit the site again to find them-and they do. "On the day after we send our messages, we see

a sharp increase in our traffic," says Seth Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren't hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to

keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to arm

themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his agent at

CareerBuilder. "You always keep your eyes open," he says. Working with a personal search agent

means having another set of eyes looking out for you.

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or made

illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet unaware of such

a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower

half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac cars

when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam

Abbott has in life over Zoe Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between the halves of the

alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between

A andK.

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C respectively;

and 26 of George Bush's predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the

alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government

of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chretien and

Koizumi). The world's three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to

the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world's five

richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the

alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant school,

teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So

short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is rarely asked the improving questions

posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have

had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual

attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists for

job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be drawn

up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.

- 5 -26. What does the author intend to illustrate with AAAA cars and Zodiac cars?

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn't biting her nails just yet. But the

47-year-old manicurist isn't cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she'd like to, either. Most of

her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped showing

up. Spero blames the softening economy. "I'm a good economic indicator," she says. "I provide a

service that people can do without when they're concerned about saving some dollars." So Spero is

downscaling, shopping at middle-brow Dillard's department store near her suburban Cleveland home,

instead of Neiman Marcus. "I don't know if other clients are going to abandon me, too," she says.

Even before Alan Greenspan's admission that America's red-hot economy is cooling, lots of

working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap outlets,

sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who last year took

in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious approach is coming

at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year's pace. But don't

sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they

remain optimistic about the economy's long-term prospects even as they do some modest

belt-tightening.

Consumers say they're not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes

still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, "there's a new

gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street

bonuses," says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied

overbidding quiets. "Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three," says John

Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to

find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower

interest rates. Employers wouldn't mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers seem

to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary ingredient

to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan's hot new Alain

Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth

toasting.

Americans today don't place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers,

and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical

education-not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive

anti-intellectualism in our schools aren't difficult to find.

"Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual," says

education writer Diane Ravitch. "Schools could be a counterbalance." Ravitch's latest book. Left Back:

A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding

they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and

understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this

path, says writer Earl Shorris, "We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil

society."

"Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege," writes historian and professor Richard

Hofstadter in Anti-intellectualism in American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of

anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says

Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism.

Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble qualities than

anything you could learn from a book.

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous

book learning put unnatural restraints on children: "We are shut up in schools and college recitation

rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing."Mark

Twain's Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being

civilized-going to school and learning to read-so he can preserve his innate goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly

admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to grasp,

manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, and

1magmes.

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country's educational

system is in the grips of people who "joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect and

their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise."

The relation of language and mind has interested philosophers for many centuries. ( 41) The

Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, which

took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be.

Only recently did linguists begin the serious study of languages that were very different from

their own. Two anthropologist-linguists, Franz Boas and Edward Sapir, were pioneers in describing

many native languages of North and South America during the first half of the twentieth century. (42)

We are obliged to them because some of these languages have since vanished, as the peoples who

spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost their native languages. Other linguists in the

earlier part of this century, however, who were less eager to deal with bizarre data from "exotic"

language, were not always so grateful. (43) The newly described languages were often so strikingly

different from the well studied languages of Europe and Southeast Asia that some scholars even

accused Boas and Sapir of fabricating their data. Native American languages are indeed different, so

much so in fact that Navajo could be used by the US military as a code during World War II to send

secret messages.

Sapir's pupil, Benjamin Lee Whorf, continued the study of American Indian languages. (44)

Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf developed the idea that the

structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society. He reasoned that

because it is easier to formulate certain concepts and not others in a given language, the speakers of

that language think along one track and not along another. ( 45) Whorf came to believe in a sort of

linguistic determinism which, in its strongest form, states that language imprisons the mind, and that

the grammatical patterns in a language can produce far-reaching consequences for the culture of a

society. Later, this idea became to be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but this term is somewhat

inappropriate. Although both Sapir and Whorf emphasized the diversity of languages, Sapir himself

never explicitly supported the notion of linguistic determinism.

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as "all too human", with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey. as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of "goods and services" than males.

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan's and Dr. de Waal's study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co­ operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel's report: "Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions."

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research - a classic case of "paralysis by analysis".

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won't take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just "mental noise" - the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is "off-line." And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. "It's your dream," says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago's Medical Center. "If you don't like it, change it."

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep - when most vivid dreams occur - as it is when fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the "emotional brain") is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex ( the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. "We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day." says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright's clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don't always think about the emotional significance of the day's events - until, it appears, we begin to dream.

And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or "we wake up in a panic," Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people's anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep- or rather dream - on it and you'll feel better in the morning.

Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to

command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such

command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of

Language and Music and Why We Should Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and

controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s

counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism

against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter's academic speciality is language

history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of "whom", for example,

to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, "doing our own thing", has spelt

the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly

educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even

the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the

page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that

could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing

over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture,

the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take

the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges

that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English,

can be powerfully expressive - there exists no language or dialect in the world that

cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer

think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of

memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech

that would seem old-fashioned

to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter

acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical

education reforms - he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more

than useful. We now take our English "on paper plates instead of china". A shame,

perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms. [B] is but all too natural in language development. [C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture. [D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s.

Canada's premiers ( the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.

They're all groaning about soaring health budgets,

the fastest-growing

component of which are pharmaceutical costs.

(41) **\_\_** \_ What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care - to say nothing of reports from other experts - recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.

(42) **\_\_** \_ But "national" doesn't have

to mean

that. "National" could mean

interprovincial - provinces combining efforts to create one body.

Either way, one benefit of a "national" organization would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province - or a series of hospitals within a province - negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.

Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.

(43) **\_\_** \_ A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.

A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That's one reason why the idea of a national list hasn't gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.

- 11 -(44) **\_\_** \_ Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow's report selectively, especially the parts

about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: "A national drug agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to try to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs."

(45) **\_\_** \_ So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients.

[A] Quebec's resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec's Drug Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!

[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby's report: "The substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies."

[C] What does "national" mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.

[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will

continue to increase faster than government revenues.

[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher pnces.

[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.

[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn't like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one's impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. ( 46) Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed - and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. (47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful; groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.

Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. ( 48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.

Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television

companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.

( 49) Creating a "European identity" that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice - that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.

In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. (50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say, "United we stand, divided we fall" - and if I had to choose a slogan it would be "Unity in our diversity." A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

In spite of "endless talk of difference," American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is "the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference" characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into "a culture of consumption" launched by the 19th­ century department stores that offered "vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite" these were stores "anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act." The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of the population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation - language, home ownership and intermarriage.

immigration

today's

that

The 1990 Census revealed that "a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English 'well' or 'very well' after ten years of residence." The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. "By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families." Hence the description of America as a "graveyard" for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics "have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks." By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet "some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation's assimilative power."

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America's turbulent past, today's social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

-3 -21. The word "homogenizing" (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means

[A] identifying. [B] associating. [C] assimilating. [D] monopolizing.

22. According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century

[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture. [B] became intimate shops for common consumers. [C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite. [D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption.

23. The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S.

[A] are resistant to homogenization. [B] exert a great influence on American culture. [C] are hardly a threat to the common culture. [D] constitute the majority of the population.

24. Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?

[A] To prove their popularity around the world. [B] To reveal the public's fear of immigrants. [C] To give examples of successful immigrants. [D] To show the powerful influence of American culture.

25. In the author's opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is

[A] rewarding. [B] successful. [C] fruitless. [D] harmful.

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry

William Shakespeare - but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway's Cottage, Shakespeare's birthplace and the other sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theater adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC's actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It's all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus - and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side - don't usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town's revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don't see it this way and the local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can't understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they'll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford's most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) - lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

-5 -26. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that

[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC's contribution to the town's revenue. [B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage. [C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms. [D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism.

27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that

[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately. [B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers. [C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers. [D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater.

28. By saying "Stratford cries poor traditionally" (Line 2, Paragraph 4), the author

implies that [A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects. [B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties. [C] the town is not really short of money. [D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid.

29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because

[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending. [B] the company is financially ill-managed. [C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable. [D] the theatre attendance is on the rise.

30. From the text we can conclude that the author

[A] is supportive of both sides. [B] favors the townsfolk's view. [C] takes a detached attitude. [D] is sympathetic to the RSC.

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals: they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators ( animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long­ fished areas, it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.

Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the "shifting baseline". The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business.

-7 -31. The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that

[A] large animals were vulnerable to the changing environment. [B] small species survived as large animals disappeared. [C] large sea animals may face the same threat today. [D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones.

32. We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm's paper that

[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%. [B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago. [C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount. [D] the number of large predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old.

33. By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, Paragraph 3), Dr. Worm

means that [A] fishing technology has improved rapidly. [B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded. [C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss. [D] the data collected so far are out of date.

34. Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that

[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time. [B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass. [C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level. [D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation.

35. The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries'

[A] management efficiency. [B] biomass level. [C] catch-size limits. [D] technological application.

Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists' only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn't always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth's daffodils to Baudelaire' s flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modem times have seen so much misery. But it's not as if earlier times didn't know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today.

After all, what is the one modem form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too. Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda - to lure us to open our wallets - they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable."Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

But what we forget - what our economy depends on us forgetting - is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

- 9 -36. By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends

to show that [A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music. [B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings. [C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness. [D] artists have changed their focus of interest.

37. The word "bummer" (Line 5, Paragraph 5) most probably means something

[A] religious. [B] unpleasant. [C] entertaining. [D] commercial.

38. In the author's opinion, advertising

[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art. [B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public. [C] replaces the church as a major source of information. [D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself.

39. We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes

[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness. [B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing. [C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied. [D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms.

40. Which of the following is true of the text?

[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery. [B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality. [C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modem society. [D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling.

He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card," which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user's gambling activities. For Williams, those activities became what he calls "electronic heroin."

(41 ) ******\_****** In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem.

In March 1998, a friend of Williams's got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams's gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote the "medical/psychological" nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being.

(42) ****\_**** \_ The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning:"Enjoy the fun ... and always bet with your head, not over it." Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams's suit charges that the casino, knowing he was "helplessly addicted to gambling," intentionally worked to "lure" him to "engage in conduct against his will." Well.

- 11 -(43) ****\_**** \_ The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says "pathological gambling" involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of the thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.

( 44) ******\_****** �Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin to physical disabilities.

(45) ****\_**** \_ Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying degrees dependent on - you might say addicted to - revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers' dollars has become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web's most profitable business.

[A] Although no such evidence was presented, the casino's marketing department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun Card without being detected.

[B] It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior.

And in what sense was his will operative?

[C] By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to even,

he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.

[D] Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.

[E] David Williams's suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don't bet on it.

[F] It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of will.

[G] The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of the intellectual. It is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.

First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? ( 46) \_I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic( in, ,Mr m [ij;) way about moral problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained.(47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.

to

referred

This definition

excludes many

individuals usually

as intellectuals - the average scientist, for one. ( 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties - he is not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. ( 49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics.

The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. (50) They may teach very well, and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing ; living in "public and illustrious thoughts," as Emerson would say, is something else.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers – whether surgery, ballet or computer programming– are nearly always made, not born.

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 – the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’ s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’ s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’ s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership – that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it's knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’ s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback – a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

the safety net offered by unemployment

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen – and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent– and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance – have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them – especially in America – the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’ s agenda in businesses of every variety.

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley – have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’ s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders”. Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’ s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.

The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore – and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.

The current state of affairs may have been encouraged – though not justified – by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’ s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.

[A] the fierce business competition. [B] the feeble boss-board relations. [C] the threat from news reports. [D] the severity of data leakage.

[A] whether there is any weak point. [B] what sort of data has been stolen. [C] who is responsible for the leakage. [D] how the potential spies can be located.

37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out

38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that

[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attendedto. [B] information protection should be given due attention. [C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security. [D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.

39. According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to

[A] see the link between trust and data protection. [B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data. [C] realize the high cost of data restoration. [D] appreciate the economic value of trust.

40. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that

[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe. [B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security. [C] California takes the lead in security legislation. [D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

How Can a Parent Help?

Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their kids. Even if a job’s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult’s need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book Ready or Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I call “work-life unreadiness”:

41 You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.

42 Kids need a range of authentic role models – as opposed to members of their clique, pop stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they want to do, they should be discouraged from saying “I have no idea.” They can change their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.

Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities.

44 Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV

shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for most jobs.

45 They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help them apply these skills to everyday life situations.

The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.

If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.

(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.

Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

While still catching up to men in some spheres of modem life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. "Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men," according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York's Veteran's Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.

Adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased "opportunities" for stress. "It's not necessarily that women don't cope as well. It's just that they have so much more to cope with," says Dr. Y ehuda. "Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men's," she observes, "it's just that they're dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner."

Dr. Y ehuda notes another difference between the sexes. "I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating."

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. "I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better." Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. "It's the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck."

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez's experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors' names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet — and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it—is making free access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavour.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report's authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today's people — especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations — apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren't likely to get any taller. "In the general population today, at this genetic, envirornnental level, we've pretty much gone as far as we can go," says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients — notably, protein — to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height — 5'9" for men, 5'4" for women — hasn't really changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. "There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism," says anthropologist William Leonard ofNorthwestem University.

Genetic maximums can change, but don't expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, "you could use today's data and feel fairly confident."

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw — having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.

That's a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the role slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation's early leaders and the fragile nature of the country's infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong — and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was "like having a large bank account," says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the "peculiar institution," including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.

And the statesmen's political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 ; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings's children — though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you stop avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. (41)

Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, but do not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, work it into the draft. (42) Grammar, punctuat10n, and spelling can wait until you revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good w 百 ting most often occurs when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.

Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if you have to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any w 百 ting on the other side.

If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity to make additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a few simple keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling and certam grammatical elements m your wntmg. (44) These printouts are also easier to read than the screen when you work on revisions.

Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper convincing. The student who wrote "The A&P as a State of Mind" wisely dropped a paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45)

Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times — and then again — working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.

- 11 -[A] To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.

[B] After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It's probably best to w 门 te the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.

[C] It's worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.

[D] It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.

[E] Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which explains how the setting influences Sammy's decision to quit his job. Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel's crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P "policy" he enforces.

Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on

auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice,

but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21 st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication.

So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and

innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop

new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump

our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.

Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can

instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the

more new things we try - the more we step outside our comfort zone - the more

inherently creative we become, both in the workplace and in our personal lives.

But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are

worn into the brain, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately press

into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.

"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of The Open Mind. "But we are taught instead to 'decide' , just as

our president calls himself 'the Decider'. " She adds, however, that "to decide is to

kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the

many other possibilities."

All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says.

Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to

approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally ( or

collaboratively) and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts

down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed

most valuable during the first decade or so of life.

The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure,

meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of

thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system - that anyone can

do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book This Year I Will ... and Ms.

Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters

commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates

excellence." This is where developing new habits comes in.

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom - or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell out $30 for a paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore - and another $120 to get the results.

More than 60, 000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first became available without prescriptions last year, according to Doug Fogg, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests directly to the public, ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $ 2, 500.

Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing, which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put up for adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists - and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots.

Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the company for testing. All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.

But some observers are skeptical. "There's a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Troy Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors - numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.

Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and not others, so a person's test results may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians alike. Progress in both areas is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political, and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that it is, because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.

Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recession and Japan at its pre-bubble peak, the U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of the primary causes of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive­ assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts - a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.

More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English-speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work.

What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10, 000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.

As education improved, humanity's productivity potential increased as well. When the competitive environment pushed our ancestors to achieve that potential, they could in tum afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is.

The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits." According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.

To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church - important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.

The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts churches in the decade after 1629, there were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.

We should not forget, however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitious quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations, and religious hope - all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father that the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "Come out from among them, touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in Puritan churches.

Meanwhile, many settlers had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New World for religion. "Our main end was to catch fish."

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection. ( 41) **\_\_\_\_** \_

American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan helped found modem anthropology - the scientific study of human societies, customs and beliefs - thus becoming one of the earliest anthropologists. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies. ( 42) **\_\_\_\_** \_

In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. (43) **\_\_\_\_** \_

Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. ( 44) \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. ( 45) **\_\_\_\_** \_

Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Emile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology.

- 11 -[A] Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had

a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.

[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, he became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.

[C] He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.

[D] They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into adulthood.

[E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.

[F] Supporters of the theory viewed culture as a collection of integrated parts that

work together to keep a society functioning.

[G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

There is a marked difference between the education which every one gets from living with others and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the association. ( 46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience, but this effect is not a part of its original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the QY:­ product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the world' s work is carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output.

But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate

human fact, gains in importance. ( 48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of training is too evident and the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. ( 49) Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. If humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely through dealings with the young.

(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education - that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same sort of association which keeps adults loyal to their group.

The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note

with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, at

Sotheby's in London on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more

than £70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As

the

auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street,

Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.

The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising

bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons

Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm - double the figure five

years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market

generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth,

enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy m a way matched by few other

industries.

In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort

became deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from

galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most

overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008.

Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had

to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with

The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped

buying Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts reckon that prices are

about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant.

But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says: "I'm pretty confident we're at

them.

the bottom."

What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still

buyers in the market. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report

said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of

good work to sell. The three Ds - death, debt and divorce - still deliver works of art

to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for

confidence to return.

because --- [A] the art market had witnessed a succession of victories

[B] the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids

[C] Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces

I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room - a

women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening, one man

had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his

wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening, I

commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them.

This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, "She's

the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and

hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work I have nothing to say.

If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."

This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more

than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is

wreaking havoc with marriage.

The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s.

Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that

most of the women she interviewed - but only a few of the men - gave lack of

communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of

nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year

a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.

In my own research, complaints from women about their husbands most often

focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to

accompany a husband to his, or doing far more than their share of daily life-support

work like cleaning, cooking and social arrangements. Instead, they focused on

communication: "He doesn't listen to me." "He doesn't talk to me." I found, as

Hacker observed years before, that most wives want their husbands to be, first and

foremost, conversational partners, but few husbands share this expectation of their

wives.

In short, the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical

cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front

of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk.

Over the past decade, many compames had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors - habits - among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks or wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.

"There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers only because we can't figure out how to change people's habits," said Dr. Curtis, the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. "We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically."

The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to - Procter & Gamble, Colgate- Palmolive and Unilever - had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers' lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.

If you look hard enough, you'll find that many of the products we use every day

- chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins - are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of shrewd advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.

A few decades ago, many people didn't drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.

"Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns," said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. "Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers' lives, and it's essential to making new products commercially viable."

Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through ruthless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods.

Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete express10n of crucial

democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal

qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors

should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community;

that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race,

religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and

that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter

of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than

representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing

themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.

But as recently as in 1968, jury selection procedures conflicted with these

democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of

supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the

Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in

jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of

selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this

and other antidiscrimination laws.

The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th

century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until

the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then

several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally

asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the

claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women

through the 1960s.

In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service

Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished

special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at

random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision

Tay lor v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision

also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered

states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.

-9 -36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that \_ \_ \_

[A] both literate and illiterate people can serve on juries

[B] defendants are immune from trial by their peers

[C] no age limit should be imposed for jury service

[D] judgment should consider the opinion of the public

37. The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed \_ \_ \_

Copying Birds May Save Aircraft Fuel

Both Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft,

the 787 and A350 respectively. Their clever designs and lightweight composites

certainly make a difference. But a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by

Ilan Kroo, has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to

cutting jet-fuel use and it would not require them to buy new aircraft.

The answer, says Dr. Kroo, lies with birds. Since 1914, scientists have known

that birds flying in formation - a V-shape - expend less energy. The air flowing over a

bird's wings curls upwards behind the wingtips, a phenomenon known as upwash.

Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag, and spend less energy

propelling themselves. Peter Lissaman, an aeronautics expert who was formerly at

Caltech and the University of Southern California, has suggested that a formation of

25 birds might enjoy a range increase of71 %.

When applied to aircraft, the principles are not substantially different. Dr. Kroo

and his team modeled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los

Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas were to assemble over Utah, assume an

inverted V-formation, occasionally change places so all could have a tum in the most

favourable positions, and proceed to London. They found that the aircraft consumed as much as 15% less fuel (coupled with a reduction in carbon-dioxide output).

Nitrogen-oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by around a quarter.

There are, of course, knots to be worked out. One consideration is safety, or at least the perception of it. Would passengers feel comfortable travelling in companion?

Dr. Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles, and would not be in the intimate groupings favoured by display teams like the Red Arrows.

A passenger peering out of the window might not even see the other planes. Whether

the separation distances involved would satisfy air-traffic-control regulations is

another matter, although a working group at the International Civil Aviation

Organisation has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new

operational guidelines.

-11 -It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make

formation flight more efficient. In zones of increased turbulence, the planes' wakes

will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish. Dr. Kroo says this is one of the

areas his team will investigate further. It might also be hard for airlines to co-ordinate

the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow

them to gain from formation flight. Cargo aircraft, in contrast, might be easier to

reschedule, as might routine military flights.

As it happens, America's armed forces are on the case already. Earlier this year

the country's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay

Boeing to investigate formation flight, though the programme has yet to begin. There

are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel

during the Second World War, but Dr. Lissaman says they are unsubstantiated. "My

"Sustainability" has become a popular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the

concept will always have personal meaning. Having endured a painful period of

unsustainability in his own life made it clear to him that sustainability-oriented values

must be expressed through everyday action and choice.

Ning recalls spending a confusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He'd been through the dot-corn boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a

Boulder agency.

It didn't go well. "It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says

Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. "I was

miserable. I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and

stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, 'Just wait,

you'll turn the comer, give it some time."'

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs's board as an outside director in January 2000; a year later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much criticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman's compensation con 皿 ittee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.

Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a 伍 m's board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive's proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.

The researchers from Ohio University used a database

that covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those "surprise" disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They found that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increases by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they "trade up," leaving riskier, smaller 伍 ms for larger and more stable firms.

But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.

Whatever happened to the death of newspapers? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. News a ers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chroniclin their own doom. America's Federal Trade Commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them? It will hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.

In much of the world there is little sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled corner of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.

It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.

Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.

The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.

But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.

Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase "less is more" was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so than Mies.

Mies's signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact than a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood — materials that we take for granted today but that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies's sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty.

The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller — two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet — they were than those in their older neighbors along the city's Gold Coast. But popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings' details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.

The trend toward "less" was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses — usually around 1,200 square feet — than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.

The "Case Study Houses" commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the "less is more" trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph Rapson may have mispredicted just how the mechanical revolution would impact everyday life — few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers — but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the project's greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a "Bermuda triangle" of debt, population decline and lower growth.

As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone's economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.

Yet the debate about how to save Europe's

currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone's dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonisation within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonise.

single

Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowing, spending and competitiveness, backed by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects, and even the suspension of a country's voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference.

A "southern" camp headed by France wants something different: "European economic government" within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the Franch government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonisation: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs. It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world's largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalisation, and make capitalism benign.

Leading doctors today weigh in on the debate over the government's role in promoting public health by demanding that ministers impose "fat taxes" on unhealthy food and introduce cigarette-style warnings to children about the dangers of a poor diet.

The demands follow comments made last week by the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, who insisted the government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health regulations.

But senior medical figures want to stop fast-food outlets opening near schools, restrict advertising of products high in fat, salt or sugar, and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast-food producers such as McDonald's.

They argue that government action is necessary to curb Britain's addiction to unhealthy food and help halt spiraling rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as damaging as somking or excessive drinking.

"Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the workplace or in pubs, and yet that is what we have now. Are we willing to be just as courageous in respect of obesity? I would suggest that we should be," said the leader of the UK's children's doctors.

Lansley has alarmed health campaigners by suggesting he wants

industry rather than government to take the lead. He said that manufacturers of crisps and candies could play a central role in the Change4Life campaign, the centrepiece of government efforts to boost healthy eating and fitness. He has also criticised the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's high-profile attempt to improve school lunches in England as an example of how "lecturing" people was not the best way to change their behaviour.

Stephenson suggested potential restrictions could

include banning TV advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar before 9 pm and limiting them on billboards or in cinemas. "If we were really bold, we might even begin to think of high-calorie fast food in the same way as cigarettes — by setting strict limits on advertising, product placement and sponsorship of sports events," he said.

- 11 -Such a move could affect firms such as McDonald's, which sponsors

the youth coaching scheme run by the Football Association. Fast-food chains should also stop offering "inducements" such as toys, cute animals and mobile phone credit to lure young customers, Stephenson said.

Professor Dinesh Bhugra, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: that

"If children are taught about the impact that food has on their growth, and some things can harm, at least information is available up front."

He also urged councils to impose "fast-food-free zones" around schools and

hospitals — areas within which takeaways cannot open.

A Department of Health spokesperson said: "We need to create a new vision for public health where all of society works together to get healthy and live longer. This includes creating a new 'responsibility deal' with business, built on social responsibility, not state regulation. Later this year, we will publish a white paper setting out exactly how we will achieve this."

The food industry will be alarmed that such senior doctors back such radical moves, especially the call to use some of the tough tactics that have been deployed against smoking over the last decade.

producers such as McDonald's.

Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on this educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student's academic grade.

This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished is or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework. But the policy unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be assigned that students cannot complete on their own or that they cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.

District administrators say that homework will still be a part of schooling; teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.

truly

At the same time, the policy addresses none of the

thorny questions about homework. If the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students' academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework matters, it should account for a significant portion of the grade. Meanwhile, this policy does nothing to ensure that the homework students receive is meaningful or appropriate to their age and the subject, or that teachers are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.

The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is the matter and conducts

responsible for setting educational policy, looks public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework right.

Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young girls' lives. It is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tinv slice of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girls' identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, I despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls' lives and interests.

that pink

is not

Girls' attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What's more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses. When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children's marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, when it began to seem inherently attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.

I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children's behaviour: wrong. Tums out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularised as a marketing trick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.

Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should create a "third stepping stone" between infant wear and older kids' clothes. It was only after "toddler" became a common shoppers' term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences — or invent them where they did not previously exist.

In 2010, a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its

core. Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades — by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was a "preliminary step" in a longer battle.

just

On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.

But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule "is no less a product of nature…than are cotton fibres that have been separated from cotton seeds."

reward

than

Despite the appeals court's decision, big questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

As the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules — most are already patented or in the public domain. Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug's efficacy. Companies are eager to win patents for "connecting the dots," explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.

Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO lawyers on the recently held a convention which included sessions to coach shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was packed.

The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends, it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character of our society for years.

No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways: they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.

But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S., lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean­ spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.

Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed, this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them — especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist at Columbia University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.

In the Internet age, it is particularly easy to see

the resentment that has always been hidden within American society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society's character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly will reshape it, and all the more so the longer they extend.

"Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here," wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well, not any more it is not.

Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favorite historical form. This could be no more than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with learning from our forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.

From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus — On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, he championed cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.

the uniqueness of

Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day, stressing the artist's personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samuel Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers, industrialists and explorers. "The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, of patient purpose, resolute working, and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formation of truly noble and manly character, exhibit," wrote Smiles, "what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself." His biographies of James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.

This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals.

Not everyone was convinced by such bombast. "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," wrote Marx and Engels in The

- 11 -Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles: "It is man, real, living man who does all that." And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle, As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past."

This was the tradition which revolutionised our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole — from gender to race to cultural studies — were opened new realms of understanding up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.

Lots of studies have found that well-educated people from developing countries are particularly likely to emigrate. A big survey of Indian households in 2004 found that nearly 40% of emigrants had more than a high-school education, compared with around 3.3% of all Indians over the age 25. This "brain drain" has long bothered policymakers in poor countries.

In an essay entitled "Making It in America," the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has only two employees today, "a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines."

Davidson's article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers.

In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to. It can't when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra — their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there's been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, "In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs — about 6 million in total — disappeared."

There will always be change — new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I. T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.

In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G. I. Bill for the 2l 8t century that ensures that every American has access to post­ high school education.

Between 1908 and 1915, about 7 million people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian immigrants, for example, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, "uccelli di passaggio," birds of passage.

Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into two categories: legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or brand them as aliens to be kicked out. That framework has contributed mightily to our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don't need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal. To start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.

Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today's birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work, money and ideas. They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them. They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another.

With or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably.

Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle. Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes, including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.

Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.

Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like neuroticism or open -mindedness.

But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren't exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we're doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long. Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases — or hire outside screeners.

John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly "thin slice" information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in "thick sliced" long­ term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a much longer evaluation: two days, not two seconds.

Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: dogs can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the way we react, it hasn't changed our nature. We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.

Europe is not a gender-equality heaven. In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family-friendly until women are part of senior management decisions, and Europe's top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male. Indeed, women hold only 14 per cent of positions on European corporate boards.

The European Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women — up to 60 per cent. This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 per cent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.

Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate

ladder fairly as they balance work and family?

"Personally, I don't like quotas," Reding said recently. "But I like what the quotas do." Quotas get action: they "open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling," according to Reding, a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.

I understand Reding's reluctance — and her frustration. I don't like quotas either; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy, governance by the capable. But, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.

After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions — no matter how much "soft pressure" is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of corporate power — as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook — they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.

If appropriate public policies were in place to help all women — whether CEOs or their children's caregivers — and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person hvmg m a more Just society.

The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his love of good food with living on benefits. After bills, Tony has £ 60 a week to spend, £ 40 of which goes on food, but 10 years ago he was earning £ 130,000 a year working in corporate communications and eating at London's best restaurants at least twice a week. Then his marriage failed, his career burned out and his drinking became serious. "The community mental health team saved my life. And I felt like that again, to a certain degree, when people responded to the blog so well. It gave me the validation and confidence that I'd lost. But it's still a day-by-day thing." Now he's living in a council flat and fielding offers from literary agents. He's feeling positive, but he' 11 carry on blogging — not about eating as cheaply as you can — "there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely any money to spend on food" — but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies.

Impulsive spending isn't an option, so plan your week's menu in advance, making shopping lists for your ingredients in their exact quantities. I have an Excel template for a week of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stop laughing: it's not just cost effective but helps you balance your diet. It's also a good idea to shop daily instead of

42.

This is where supermarkets and their anonymity come in handy. With them, there's not the same embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little greengrocer. And if you plan properly, you'll know that you only need, say, 350g of shin of beef and six rashers of bacon, not whatever weight is pre-packed in the supermarket chiller. 43.

You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas in the freezer — that's not good enough. Mine is filled with leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. Planning ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables you'll do a vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to "go off' will be cooked or juiced. 44.

Everyone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers, delis and fish-sellers regularly, even for small things, and be super friendly. Soon you'll feel comfortable asking if they've any knuckles of ham for soups and stews, or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads for stock which, more often than not, they'll let you have for free. 45.

You won't be eating out a lot, but save your pennies and once every few months treat yourself to a set lunch at a good restaurant — £ 1.75 a week for three months gives you £ 21 — more than enough for a three-course lunch at Michelin-starred Arbutus. It's £ 16.95 there — or £ 12.99 for a large pizza from Domino's: I know which I'd rather eat.

I can pick a date from the past 53 years and know instantly where I was, what happened in the news and even the day of the week. I've been able to do this since I was four.

I never feel overwhelmed with the amount of information my brain absorbs. My mind seems to be able to cope and the information is stored away neatly. When I think of a sad memory, I do what everybody does - try to put it to one side. I don't think it's harder for me just because my memory is clearer. Powerful memory doesn't make my emotions any more acute or vivid. I can recall the day my grandfather died and the sadness I felt when we went to the hospital the day before. I also remember that the musical play Hair opened on Broadway on the same day — they both just pop into my mind in the same way.

What would you do with $590m? This is now a question for Gloria MacKenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings of fulfilment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton.

These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly. What was once exciting and new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms Dunn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time

- as stories or memories - particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.

This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it). Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason McDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib — a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.

Readers of Happy Money are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfilment, not hunger. Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity e 呻 ances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors' policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent.

An article in Scientific American has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually, you think you're more beautiful than you are. We have a deep­ seated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies to achieve this. Social psychologists have amassed oceans of research into what they call the "above average effect", or "illusory superiority", and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% at getting on well with others - all obviously statistical impossibilities.

We rose-tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become defensive when criticised, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem. We stalk around thinking we're hot stuff.

Psychologist and behavioural scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key study into self-enhancement and attractiveness. Rather than have people simply rate their beauty compared with others, he asked them to identify an original photograph of themselves from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is "an automatic psychological process, occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation". If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image — which most did — they genuinely believed it was really how they looked.

Epley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that those who self-e 呻 anced the most (that is, the participants who thought the most positively doctored pictures were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In fact, those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those who showed other markers for having higher self-esteem. "I don't think the findings that we have are any evidence of personal delusion," says Epley. "It's a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of themselves." If you are depressed, you won't be self­ enhancing.

Knowing the results of Epley's study, it makes sense that many people hate photographs of themselves viscerally — on one level, they don't even recognise the person in the picture as themselves. Facebook, therefore, is a self-enhancer's paradise, where people can share only the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit, style, beauty, intellect and lifestyles. It's not that people's profiles are dishonest, says Catalina Toma of Wisconsin-Madison University, "but they portray an idealised version of themselves."

The concept of man versus machine is at least as old as the industrial revolution, but this phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries. And yet, it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painful side of a boom and bust cycle. Certain jobs have gone away for good, outmoded by machines. Since technology has such an insatiable appetite for eating up human jobs, this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy in ways we cannot immediately foresee.

When there is rapid improvement in the price and performance of technology, jobs that were once thought to be immune from automation suddenly become threatened. This argument has attracted a lot of attention, via the success of the book Race Against the Machine, by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who both hail from MIT's Center for Digital Business.

This is a powerful argument, and a scary one. And yet, John Hagel, author of the

The Power of Pull and other books, says Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss reason why these jobs are so vulnerable to technology in the first place.

Hagel says we have designed jobs in the U.S. that tend to be "tightly scripted" and "highly standardized" ones that leave no room for "individual initiative or creativity". In short, these are the types of jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings. That is how we have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers, Hagel says.

It's time to reinvent the formula for how work is conducted, since we are still relying on a very 20th century notion of work, Hagel says. In our rapidly changing economy, we more than ever need people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise their imagination "to respond to unexpected events". That is not something machines are good at. They are designed to perform very predictable activities.

As Hagel notes, Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point in their book. We need to reframe race against the machine as race with the machine. In other words, we need to look at the ways in which machines can augment human labor rather than replace it. So then the problem is not really about technology, but rather, "how do we innovate our institutions and our work practices?"

When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.

Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at con 皿 unicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure projects, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.

Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase

all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes.

The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.

There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.

the amount

Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.

But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing £ 4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in 2015, is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition's spending plans if it returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to the era of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.

While the government's commitment to long-term funding may have changed,

the very pressing need for more affordable housing is real and is not going away.

Emerging in the late Sixties and reaching a peak in the Seventies, Land Art was one of a range of new forms, including Body Art, Performance Art, Action Art and Installation Art, which pushed art beyond the traditional confines of the studio and gallery. Rather than portraying landscape, land artists used the physical substance of the land itself as their medium.

than

its American counterpart.

The British land art, typified by Richard Long's piece, was not only more domestically scaled, but a lot quirkier Indeed, while you might assume that an exhibition of Land Art would consist only of records of works rather than the works themselves, Long's photograph of his work is the work. Since his "action" is in the past, the photograph is its sole embodiment. That might seem rather an obscure point, but it sets the tone for an exhibition that contains a lot of black-and-white photographs and relatively few natural objects. Long is Britain's best-known Land Artist and his Stone Circle, a perfect ring of purplish rocks from Portishead beach laid out on the gallery floor, represents the elegant, rarefied side of the form. The Boyle Family, on the other hand, stand for its dirty, urban aspect. Comprising artists Mark Boyle and Joan Hills and their children, they recreated random sections of the British landscape on gallery walls. Their Olaf Street Study, a square of brick-strewn waste ground, is one of the few works here to embrace the commonplaceness that characterises most of our experience of the landscape most of the time.

Parks feature, particularly in the earlier works, such as John Hilliard's very funny Across the Park, in which a long-haired stroller is variously smiled at by a pretty girl and unwittingly assaulted in a sequence of images that tum out to be different parts of the same photograph.

Generally however British land artists preferred to get away from towns, gravitating towards landscapes that are traditionally considered beautiful such as the Lake District or the Wiltshire Downs. While it probably wasn't apparent at the time, much of this work is permeated by a spirit of romantic escapism that the likes of Wordsworth would have readily understood. Derek Jarman's yellow-tinted film Towards Avebury, a collection of long, mostly still shots of the Wiltshire landscape, evokes a tradition of English landscape painting stretching from Samuel Palmer to Paul Nash.

In

the case of Hamish Fulton, you can't help feeling that the Scottish artist has simply found a way of making his love of walking pay. A typical work, such as

Most people would define optimism as being endlessly happy, with a glass that's perpetually half full. But that's exactly the kind of false cheerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn't recommend. "Healthy optimism means being in touch with reality," says Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor. According to Ben­ Shahar, realistic optimists are those who make the best of things that happen, but not those who believe everything happens for the best.

Ben-Shahar uses three optimistic exercises. When he feels down — say, after giving a bad lecture — he grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself that not every lecture can be a Nobel winner; some will be less effective than others. Next is reconstruction. He analyzes the weak lecture, learning lessons for the future about what works and what doesn't. Finally, there is perspective, which involves acknowledging that in the grand scheme of life, one lecture really doesn't matter.

A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys, people are actually more stressed at home than at work. Researchers measured people's cortisol, which is a stress marker, while they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.

"Fu 门 her contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home," writes one of the researchers, Sarah Damaske. In fact women even say they feel better at work, she notes. "It is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work." Another surprise is that the findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why people who work outside the home have better health.

What the study doesn't measure is whether people are still doing work when they're at home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home, they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women, it's not surprising that women are more stressed at home.

But it's not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what they're supposed to be doing: working, making money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure: Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.

On the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most of them. Your home colleagues — — have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it, or if they're teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they're your family. You cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.

So it's not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the

tasks apparently infinite, the co-workers are much harder to motivate .

For years, studies have found that first-generation college students - those who do not have a parent with a college degree — lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created "a paradox" in that recruiting first-generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has "continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close" an achievement gap based on social class, according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science.

But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach (which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap (measured by such factors as grades) between first-generation and other students.

The authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findings are based on a study involving 147 students (who completed the project) at an unnamed private university. First generation was defined as not having a parent with a four­ year college degree. Most of the first-generation students (59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell Grants, a federal grant for undergraduates with financial need, while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students with at least one parent with a four-year degree.

Their thesis — that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact — was based on the view that first-generation students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students. They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be narrowed to close the achievement gap.

Many first-generation students "struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education, learn the 'rules of the game,' and take advantage of college resources," they write. And this becomes more of a problem when colleges don't talk about the class advantages and disadvantages of different groups of students. "Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students' educational experiences, many first-generation students lack insight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students 'like them' can improve.

Even in traditional offices, "the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much more emotional and much more right-brained than it was 20 years ago," said Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn. She started spinning off examples. "If you and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990, we would see much less frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals, there were strategies, there were objectives, but we didn't talk about energy; we didn't talk about passion.

Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very "team" - oriented - and not by coincidence. "Let's not forget sports - in male-dominated corporate America, it's still a big deal. It's not explicitly conscious; it's the idea that I'm a coach, and you're my team, and we're in this together. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies, but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win. "

These terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning — and, as Rakesh Khurana, another professor, points out, increase allegiance to the 伍 m. "You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit organizations and religious organizations: terms like vision, values, passion, and purpose," said Khurana.

This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work-life balance. The "mommy wars" of the 1990s are still going on today, prompting arguments about why women still can't have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In, whose title has become a buz 研 ord in its own right. Terms like unplug, offline, lifi. 动 ack, bandwidth, and capacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home. But if your work is your "passion," you'll be more likely to devote yourself to it, even if that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed.

But this seems to be the irony of office speak: Everyone makes fun of it, but managers love it, companies depend on it, and regular people willingly absorb it. As a linguist once said, "You can get people to think it's nonsense at the same time that you buy into it." In a workplace that's fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning, office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work — and how your work defines who you are.

Many people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reported for June, along with the drop in the unemployment rate to 6.1 percent, as good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace.

However, there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked. There was a big jump in the number of people who report voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000 ( 4.4 percent) above its year ago level. Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.

There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000 (7.9 percent) from its year ago level.

We know

the difference between voluntary and

involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The survey used by the Labor Departinent asks people if they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the answer is "yes," they are classified as working part-time. The survey then asks whether they worked less than 35 hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice. They are only classified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.

The issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment. For many people, especially those with serious health conditions or family members with serious health conditions, before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance.

However, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance.

Some Old Truths to Help You Overcome Tough Times

Unfortunately, life is not a bed of roses. We are going through life facing sad experiences. Moreover, we are grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a romantic relationship or a house. Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time, but you should remember that they won't last forever.

When our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life. Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and happiness. I want to share these old truths I've learned along the way. 41.

Fear is both useful and harmful. This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it. Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. My favorite actor Will Smith once said, "Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice." I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination. 42.

- 11 -If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment. Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future. You may feel guilt over your past, but you are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change. Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive. Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see the possibilities before you. Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that can be designed into the present.

43.

Sometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something. 44.

No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remember that you are not alone. Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people. You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor, help and companionship. If you have no friends or relatives, try to participate in several online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement. 45. Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from external sources. This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life. When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your decision is the best. You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices.

Think about driving a route that's very familiar. It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it's easy to lose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.

This is the well-travelled road effect: People tend to underestimate the time it

takes to travel a familiar route.

The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we don't have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter.

It's true that high-school coding classes aren't essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science.

However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it's not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers — but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It's not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.

Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or -determined students away.

The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that's become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but "we try to gear lessons toward things they're interested in," said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.

The students in the Flatiron class probably won't drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the "Ruby on Rails" language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn — how to think logically through a problem and organize the results — apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehom, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.

Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers — in their pockets, in their offices, in their homes — for the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how computers think, how to 凶 埜 the machine into producing what they want — the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that — the better.

Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens — a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands — once lent red to the often grey landscape of the midwestem and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species' historic range.

The crash was a major reason the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) decided to formally list the bird as threatened. "The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation," said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as "endangered," a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats. But Ashe and others argued that the "threatened" tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservation approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action, and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken's habitat.

Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowners or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range-wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat. USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (W AFW A), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let "states remain in the driver's seat for managing the species," Ashe said.

Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric. Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not surprisingly, industry groups and states generally argue it goes too far; enviromnentalists say it doesn't go far enough. "The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction," says biologist Jay Lininger.

That everyone's too busy these days is a cliche. But one specific complaint is

made especially mournfully: There's never any time to read.

What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don't seem sufficient. The web's full of articles offering tips on making time to read: "Give up TV" or "Carry a book with you at all times." But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn't work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning - or else you're so exhausted that a challenging book's the last thing you need. The modem mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, "is overwhelmingly inclined toward con 皿 unication… It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption." Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can't be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.

In fact, "becoming more efficient" is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instnunentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal. Immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it in as a to-do list item and you'll — useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling manage only goal-focused reading kind. "The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt," writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and ''we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes) as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them." No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.

So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You'd think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us "step outside time's flow" into "soul time." You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. "Carry a book with you at all times" can actually work, too — providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you're "making time to read," but just reading, and making time for everything else.

Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.

Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they off er strikingly different paths for reaching it.

Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.

From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining all priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics. Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those "just getting started in life" face a tougher climb than earlier generations in reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing. Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-year-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs, says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said, "I can't afford to pay my monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to make that happen." Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. "I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn't have college degrees," Schneider said. "I don't think people are capable of that anymore."

.

[A] trying out different lifestyles

[B] having a family with children

[C] working beyond retirement age

[D] setting up a profitable business

[A] favor a slower life pace

[B] hold an occupation longer

[C] attach importance to pre-marital finance

[D] give priority to childcare outside the home

[B] the old made more life achievements

[C] housing loans today are easy to obtain

[D] getting established is harder for the young

[A] He found a dream job after graduating from college.

[B] His parents believe working steadily is a must for success.

[C] His parents' good life has little to do with a college degree.

As adults, it seems that we are constantly pursuing happiness, often with mixed results. Yet children appear to have it down to an art — and for the most part they don't need self-help books or therapy. Instead, they look after their wellbeing instinctively, and usually more effectively than we do as grownups. Perhaps it's time to learn a few lessons from them.

41.

What does a child do when he's sad? He cries. When he's angry? He shouts. Scared? Probably a bit of both. As we grow up, we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don't dictate our behaviours, which is in many ways a good thing. But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing emotions, especially negative ones. That's about as effective as brushing dirt under a carpet and can even make us ill. What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and express what we feel appropriately, and then — again, like children - move on. 42.

A couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was nine years old at the time, got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed, and couldn't stop talking about it. Too often we believe that a new job, bigger house or better car will be the magic silver bullet that will allow us to finally be content, but the reality is these things have very lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day

44.

Have you ever noticed how much children laugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies, increase good hormones like endorphins, improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off infection. All of which would, of course, have a positive effect on our happiness levels.

The problem with being a grownup is that there's an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with — work, mortgage payments, figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it's important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things we things might be social, sporting, creative or completely random (dancing around the living room, anyone?) - it doesn't matter, so long as they're enjoyable, and not likely to have negative side effects, such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you're on a tight budget. 45.

love. Those

Having said all of the above, it's important to add that we shouldn't try too hard to be happy. Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said: "Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness." And in that, once more, we need to look to the example of our children, to whom happiness is not a goal but a natural byproduct of the way they live.

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you'll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you'll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,000 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally — which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.

Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their local park. The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley's world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.

Parkrun is succeeding where London's Olympic "legacy" is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to lever a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run-up to 2012 - but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to "inspire a generation." The success of Parkrun offers answers.

Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sport and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers.

Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally "grassroots" concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods — making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.

With so much focus on children's use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use. "Tech is designed to really suck you in," says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play, "and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine."

Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who used devices during the exercise started 20 per cent fewer verbal and 39 per cent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.

Infants are wired to look at parents' faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive - as they often are when absorbed in a device — it can be extremely disconcerting for the children. Radesky cites the "still face experiment" devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback: The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother's attention. "Parents don't have to be exquisitely present at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says Radesky.

On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an "oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting" with their children: "It's based on a somewhat fantasised, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you're failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them." Tronick believes that just because a child isn't learning from the screen doesn't mean there's no value to it — particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets them be more available to their child the rest of the time.

Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn't academic.

But while this may be true, it's not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated "race to the finish line," whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or a lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits - in fact, it probably enhances it.

Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes — all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders.

If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn't surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of the vast academic possibilities that await them in college. Many students find themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on.

Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist in fire ecology and management.

In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual budget fighting fires - nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work - such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep — that affect the lives of all Americans.

Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?

"It's already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country," he says. "We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, 'Wait a minute, is this OK?' Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?"

Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today

views fire, researchers say.

For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade, the focus has been on climate change — how the warming of the Earth from gree 呻 ouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires.

While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn't come at the expense

of the rest of the equation.

"The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both ways," he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to "an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited."

At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws, policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.

"We've disconnected ourselves from living with fire," Balch says. "It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today."

The decline in American manufacturing is a common refrain, particularly from Donald Trump. "We don't make anything anymore," he told Fox News, while defending his own made-in-Mexico clothing line.

Without question, manufacturing has taken a significant hit during recent decades, and further trade deals raise questions about whether new shocks could hit manufacturing.

But there is also a different way to look at the data. Across the country, factory owners are now grappling with a new challenge: Instead of having too many workers, they may end up with too few. Despite trade competition and outsourcing, American manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers every year. Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place. Other industries are recruiting them with similar or better pay.

For factory owners, it all adds up to stiff competition for workers — and upward pressure on wages. "They're harder to find and they have job offers," says Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil Spring, a family-owned firm, "They may be coming [into the workforce], but they've been plucked by other industries that are also doing as well as manufacturing." Mr. Dunwell has begun bringing high school juniors to the factory so they can get exposed to its culture.

At RoMan Manufacturing, a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment that his father cofounded in 1980, Robert Roth keeps a close eye on the age of his nearly 200 workers. Five are retiring this year. Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years.

At a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist looks flustered by the copper coils he's trying to assemble and the arrival of two visitors. It's his first week on the job. Asked about his choice of career, he says at high school he considered medical school before switching to electrical engineering. "I love working with tools. I love creating," he says.

But to win over these young workers, manufacturers have to clear another

- 11 -major hurdle: parents, who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression, telling them to avoid the factory. Millennials "remember their father and mother both were laid off. They blame it on the manufacturing recession," says Birgit Klohs, chief executive of The Right Place, a business development agency for western Michigan.

These concerns aren't misplaced: Employment in manufacturing has fallen from 17 million in 1970 to 12 million in 2015. When the recovery began, worker shortages first appeared in the high-skilled trades. Now shortages are appearing at the mid-skill levels.

"The gap is between the jobs that take no skills and those that require a lot of skill," says Rob Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College. "There're enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don't need to have much skill. It's that gap in between, and that's where the problem IS. "

Julie Parks of Grand Rapids Community College points to another key to luring Millennials into manufacturing: a work/life balance. While their parents were content to work long hours, young people value flexibility. "Overtime is not attractive to this generation. They really want to live their lives," she says.

My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing. Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course. However, during that course I realized I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me. Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. But, to be honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream — I knew that no one could imagine me in the fashion industry at all! So I decided to look for some fashion-related courses that included writing. This is when I noticed the course "Fashion Media & Promotion."

It is curious that Stephen Koziatek feels almost as though he has to justify his

efforts to give his students a better future.

Mr. Koziatek is part of something pioneering. He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and mechanical memorization, but practical. When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the 13th president of the United States but be utterly overwhelmed by a broken bike chain?

As Koziatek knows, there is learning in just about everything. Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum. They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle.

But he's also found a kind of insidious prejudice. Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority. Schools in the family of vocational education "have that stereotype…that it's for kids who can't make it academically," he says.

On one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America's evolution. Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was. The job security that the US economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated. More education is the new principle. We want more for our kids, and rightfully so.

But the headlong push into bachelor's degrees for all — and the subtle devaluing of anything less — misses an important point: That's not the only thing the American economy needs. Yes, a bachelor's degree opens more doors. But even now, 54 percent of the jobs in the country are middle-skill jobs, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. But only 44 percent of workers are adequately trained.

In other words, at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head, frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing, one obvious solution is staring us in the face. There is a gap in working-class jobs, but the workers who need those jobs most aren't equipped to do them. Koziatek's Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap.

Koziatek's school is a wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, it

risks overlooking a nation's diversity of gifts.

While fossil fuels - coal, oil, gas - still generate roughly 85 percent of the world's energy supply, it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world: They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line.

Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables, especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.

In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland, for example, wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world takes the lead, notably China and Europe, the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In March, for the first time, wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US, reported the US Energy Information Administration.

President Trump has underlined fossil fuels — especially coal — as the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa, he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play well with many in Iowa, where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state's electricity generation - and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers.

The question "what happens when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine?" has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely.

The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers, who are placing big bets on battery-powered electric vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years. While there's a long way to go, the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The perhaps just in time pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change. What Washington does — or doesn't do — to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought.

The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is astonishing­ Amazon has just announced the purchase of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods for $ 13.Sbn, but two years ago Facebook paid even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service, which doesn't have any physical product at all. What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed web of its users' friendships and social lives.

Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to Facebook identities, but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through. Even without knowing what was in the messages, the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be. What political journalist, what party whip, would not want to know the makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Theresa May's enemies are currently plotting? It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns, but the records of which customers have purchased what.

Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power. But it is clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow compared to the pace of change within the digital economy. By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace, to be replaced by new abuses of power. But there is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the users of these services don't pay for them. The users of their services are not their customers. That would be the people who buy advertising from them - and Facebook and Google, the two virtual giants, dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies.

The product they're selling is data, and we, the users, convert our lives to data for the benefit of the digital giants. Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew they produce when they feed, so Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield. Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes. It doesn't feel like a human or democratic relationship, even if both sides benefit.

To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy, Cal Newport, author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, recommends building a habit of "deep work" - the ability to focus without distraction.

There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work - be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a "journalistic" approach to seizing moments of deep work when you can throughout the day. Whichever approach, the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it.

Newport also recommends "deep scheduling" to combat constant interruptions and get more done in less time. "At any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar, I protect this time like I would a doctor's appointment or important meeting", he writes.

Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you prioritise your day - in particular how we craft our to-do lists. Tim Harford, author of Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives, points to a study in the early 1980s that divided undergraduates into two groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan activities and goals in much more detail, day by day.

While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.

In order to make the most of our focus and energy, we also need to embrace

downtime, or as Newport suggests, "be lazy".

"Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body… [idleness] is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done," he argues.

Srini Pillay, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes this counterintuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate. When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task, they tend to be more efficient.

"What people don't realise is that in order to complete these tasks they need to

use both the focus and unfocus circuits in their brain," says Pillay.

Five ways to make conversation with anyone

Conversations are links, which means when you have a conversation with a new person a link gets formed and every conversation you have after that moment will strengthen the link.

You meet new people every day: the grocery worker, the cab driver, new people at work or the security guard at the door. Simply starting a conversation with them will form a link.

Here are five simple ways that you can make the first move and start a

conversation with strangers. 41.

Suppose you are in a room with someone you don't know and something within you says "I want to talk with this person" — this is something that mostly happens with all of us. You wanted to say something — the first word — but it just won't come out, it feels like it is stuck somewhere. I know the feeling and here is my advice: just get it out.

Just think: what is the worst that could happen? They won't talk with you? Well,

they are not talking with you now!

I truly believe that once you get that first word out everything else will just flow.

- 11 -So keep it simple: "Hi", "Hey"or "Hello" — do the best you can to gather all of the enthusiasm and energy you can, put on a big smile and say "Hi".

42.

It is a problem all of us face; you have limited time with the person that you

want to talk with and you want to make this talk memorable.

Honestly, if we got stuck in the rut of "hi", "hello", "how are you?" and ''what is going on?", you will fail to give the initial jolt to the conversation that can make it so memorable.

So don't be afraid to ask more personal questions. Trust me, you'll be surprised

to see how much people are willing to share if you just ask. 43.

When you meet a person for the first time, make an effort to find the things which you and that person have in common so that you can build the conversation from that point. When you start conversation from there and then move outwards, you'll find all of a sudden that the conversation becomes a lot easier. 44.

Imagine you are pouring your heart out to someone and they are just busy on

their phone, and if you ask for their attention you get the response "I canmultitask".

So when someone tries to communicate with you, just be in that communication wholeheartedly. Make eye contact. Trust me, eye contact is where all the magic happens. When you make eye contact, you can feel the conversation. 45.

You all came into a conversation where you first met the person, but after some time you may have met again and have forgotten their name. Isn't that awkward! So, remember the little details of the people you met or you talked with; perhaps the places they have been to, the places they want to go, the things they like, the things they hate — whatever you talk about.

When you remember such things you can automatically become investor in their

wellbeing. So they feel a responsibility to you to keep that relationship going.

That's it. Five amazing ways that you can make conversation with almost anyone.

Every person is a really good book to read, or to have a conversation with!

A fifth grader gets a homework assignment to select his future career path from a list of occupations. He ticks "astronaut" but quickly adds "scientist" to the list and selects it as well. The boy is convinced that if he reads enough, he can explore as many career paths as he likes. And so he reads - everything from encyclopedias to science fiction novels. He reads so passionately that his parents have to institute a "no reading policy" at the dinner table.

That boy was Bill Gates, and he hasn't stopped reading yet - not even after becoming one of the most successful people on the planet. Nowadays, his reading material has changed from science fiction and reference books: recently, he revealed that he reads at least 50 nonfiction books a year. Gates chooses nonfiction titles because they explain how the world works. "Each book opens up new avenues of knowledge to explore", Gates says.

Unlike so-called basic emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger, guilt emerges a little later, in conjunction with a child's growing grasp of social and moral norms. Children aren't born knowing how to say "I'm sorry"; rather, they learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends - and their own consciences. This is why researchers generally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing.

In the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable - it's the emotional equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. "There has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve," says Amrisha Yaish, a psychology researcher at the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren't binary — feelings that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.

And guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue.

Viewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing. Some kids who are low in sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice versa: High sympathy can substitute for low guilt.

In a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children. Using caregiver assessments and the children's self-observations, she rated each child's overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after moral transgressions. Then the kids were handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to share them with an anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared appeared to tum on how inclined they were to feel guilty. The guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn't magically become more sympathetic to the other child's deprivation.

"That's good news, " Malti says. "We can be prosocial because we caused harm

and we feel regret."

Forests give us shade, quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to do so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.

Thankfully, there is a way out of this trap — but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as valuable "carbon sinks" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to absorb carbon now. California is leading the way, as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details.

The state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees draw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to pull carbon from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable. Even in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.

The need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and insects have killed over 100 million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres.

California plans to treat 35, 000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030 — financed from the proceeds of the state's emissions-permit auctions. That's only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a million acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought.

The strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on transportation biofuels is already under way.

State governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon. California's plan, which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year, should serve as a model.

American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years. The complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for farm workers. Congress has obstructed efforts to create a more straightforward visa for agricultural workers that would let foreign workers stay longer in the U.S. and change jobs within the industry. If this doesn't change, American businesses, communities, and consumers will be the losers.

Perhaps half of U.S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the country, the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today's farm laborers, while still predominantly born in Mexico, are more likely to be settled rather than migrating and more likely to be married than single. They're also aging. At the start of this century, about one-third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now more than half are. And picking crops is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it's been all along: Native U.S. workers won't be returning to the farm.

Mechanization isn't the answer, either — not yet, at least. Production of com, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat has been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries, need labor. Even dairy farms, where robots do a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they're automated.

As a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps in the workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply; from 2011 to 2016 the number of visas issued more than doubled. The H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work, which is limited to 66,000 a year. Even so, employers complain they aren't given all the workers they need. The process is cumbersome, expensive, and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led the average H-2A worker to arrive on the job 22 days late. The shortage is compounded by federal immigration

raids, which remove some workers and drive others underground.

In a 2012 survey, 7 1 percent of tree-fruit growers and almost 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor. Some western farmers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998 to 2000, 14.5 percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imp orts was 25.8 percent.

In effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dia Mirza and Adrian Grenier have a message for you: It's easy to beat plastic. They're part of a bunch of celebrities starring in a new video for World Environment Day — encouraging you, the consumer, to swap out your single-use plastic staples like straws and cutlery to combat the plastics crisis.

The key messages that have been put together for World Envirornnent Day do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single-use plastics. But the overarching message is directed at individuals.

My concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved. On their own, taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws, for example, will accomplish little and require very little of us. They could even be detrimental, satisfying a need to have "done our bit" without ever progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions - a kind of "moral licensing" that allays our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more of those in charge.

While the conversation around our envirornnent and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws, we're ignoring the balance of power that implies that as "consumers" we must shop sustainably, rather than as "citizens" hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change.

It's important to acknowledge that the environment isn't everyone's priority — or even most people's. We shouldn't expect it to be. In her latest book, Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things, Wellesley College professor Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for the change to be structural.

This might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action, or banning single-use plastics altogether. India has just announced it will "eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022." There are also incentive-based ways of making better environmental choices easier, such as ensuring recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal.

DeSombre isn't saying people should stop caring about the environment. It's just that individual actions are too slow, she says, for that to be the only, or even primary, approach to changing widespread behavior.

None of this is about writing off the individual. It's just about putting things into perspective. We don't have time to wait. We need progressive policies that shape collective action (and rein in polluting businesses), alongside engaged citizens pushing for change.

In choosing a new home, Camille McClain's kids have a single demand: a

backyard.

McClain's little ones aren't the only kids who have an opinion when it comes to housing, and in many cases youngsters' views weigh heavily on parents' real estate decisions, according to a 2018 Harris Poll survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults.

While more families buck an older-generation proclivity to leave kids in the dark about real estate decisions, realty agents and psychologists have mixed views about the financial, personal and long-term effects kids' opinions may have.

The idea of involving children in a big decision is a great idea because it can help them feel a sense of control and ownership in what can be an overwhelming process, said Ryan Hooper, clinical psychologist in Chicago.

"Children may face serious difficulties in coping with significant moves,

especially if it removes them from their current school or support system," he said.

Greg Jaroszewski, real estate broker with Gagliardo Realty Associates, said he's not convinced that kids should be involved in selecting a home - but their opinions should be considered in regards to proximity to friends and social activities, if possible.

Younger children should feel like they're choosing their home - without actually getting a choice in the matter, said Adam Bailey, real estate attorney based in New York.

Asking them questions about what they like about the backyard of a potential home will make them feel like they're being included in the decision-making process, Bailey said.

Many of the aspects of homebuying aren't a consideration for children, said Tracey Hampson, a real estate agent based in Santa Clarita, Calif. And placing too much emphasis on their opinions can ruin a fantastic home purchase.

"Speaking with your children before you make a real estate decision is wise, but I wouldn't base the purchasing decision solely on their opinions." Hampson said.

The other issue is that many children — especially older ones — may base their real

- 11 -state knowledge on HGTV shows, said Aaron Norris of The Norris Group in Riverside, Calif.

"They love Chip and Joanna Gaines just as much as the rest of us," he said. "HGTV has seriously changed how people view real estate. It's not shelter, it's a lifestyle. With that mindset change come some serious money consequences."

Kids tend to get stuck in the features and the immediate benefits to them

personally, Norris said.

Parents need to remind their children that their needs and desires may change

over time, said Julie Gurner, a real estate analyst with FitSmallBusiness.com.

"Their opinions can change tomorrow," Gurner said. "Harsh as it may be to say, that decision should likely not be made contingent on a child's opinions, but rather made for them with great consideration into what home can meet their needs best - and give them an opportunity to customize it a bit and make it their own."

This advice is more relevant now than ever before, even as more parents want to

embrace the ideas of their children, despite the cu 订 ent housing crunch.

It is easy to underestimate English writer James Herriot. He had such a pleasant, readable style that one might think that anyone could imitate it. How many times have I heard people say, "I could write a book. I just haven't the time." Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it, "having a go at the writing game". While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world was the result of years of practicing, re-writing and reading. Like the majority of authors, he had to suffer many disappointments and rejections along the way, but these made him all the more determined to succeed. Everything he achieved in life was earned the hard way and his success in the literary field was no exception.

Rats and other animals need to be highly attuned to social signals from others so they can identify friends to cooperate with and enemies to avoid. To find out if this extends to non-living beings, Laleh Quinn at the University of California, San Diego, and her colleagues tested whether rats can detect social signals from robotic rats.

They housed eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat—one social and one for four days.The robot rats were quite minimalist, resembling a chunkier

asocial version of a computer mouse with wheels-to move around and colorful markings.

Next, the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave

During the experiment, the social robot rat followed the living rats around, played with the same toys, and opened cage doors to let trapped rats escape. Meanwhile, the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side to side. the opportunity to release them by pressing a lever.Across 18 trials each, the living rats were 52 per cent more likely on average to set the social robot free than the asocial one. This suggests that the rats perceived the social robot as a genuine social being, says Quinn. The rats may have bonded more with the social robot because it displayed behaviors like communal exploring and playing. This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it earlier, and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get trapped, she says .

"Rats have been shown to engage in multiple forms of reciprocal help and cooperation, including what is referred to as direct reciprocity where a rat will help another rat that has previously helped them," says Quinn.

The readiness of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising given its minimal design.The robot was the same size as a regular rat but resembled a simple plastic box on wheels. " We'd assumed we'd have to give it a moving head and tail, facial features, and put a scent on it to make it smell like a real rat, but that wasn't necessary, " says Janet Wiles at the University of Queensland in Australia, who helped with the research.

The finding shows how sensitive rats are to social cues, even when they come from basic robots. says Wiles. Similarly, children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings, even when they display only simple social signals. "We humans seem to be fascinated by robots, and it turns out other animals are too," says Wiles.

It is true that CEO pay has gone up-top ones may make 300 times the pay of typical workers on average, and since the mid-1970s, CEO pay for large publicly traded American corporations has, by varying estimates, gone up by about 500%. The typical CEO of a top American corporation now makes about $18.9 million a year.

The best model for understanding the growth of CEO pay is that of limited CEO talent in a world where business opportunities for the top firms are growing rapidly. The efforts of America' s highest-earning 1 % have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It's not popular to say. but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy.

Today' s CEO, at least for major American firms, must have many mere skills

than simply being able to "run the company." CEOs must have a good sense of financial markets and maybe even how the company should trade in them . They also need better public relations skills than their predecessors, as the costs of even a minor

slipup can be significant. Then there's the fact that large American companies are much more globalized than ever before, with supply chains spread across a larger number of countries. To lead in that system requires knowledge that is fairly mind-boggling. Plus, virtually all major American companies are becoming tech companies, one way or another. Beyond this, major CEOs still have to do all the day-to-day work they have always done.

The common idea that high CEO pay is mainly about ripping people off doesn't explain history very well. By most measures, corporate governance has become a lot tighter and more rigorous since the 1970s. Yet it is principally during this period of stronger governance that CEO pay has been high and rising. That suggests it is in the broader corporate interest to recruit top candidates for increasingly tough jobs.

Furthermore, the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside candidates, not to the cozy insider picks, another sign that high CEO pay is not some kind of depredation at the expense of the rest of the company. And the stock market reacts positively when companies tie CEO pay to, say, stock prices, a sign that those practices build up corporate value not just for the CEO.

[A] The growth in the number of corporations. [B] The general pay rise with a better economy. [C] Increased business opportunities for top firms. [D] Close cooperation among leading economies.

27. Compared with their predecessors, today' s CEOs are required to

Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars. Seven months and one election day later, a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of the clean air zone, a first step toward its possible demise.

Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida made opposition to the zone a centrepiece of his election campaign, despite its success in improving air quality. A judge has now overruled the city's decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. But with legal battles ahead, the zone's future looks uncertain at best.

Among other weaknesses, the measures cities must employ when left to tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious, and therefore vulnerable. That's because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers—who must pay fees or buy better vehicles —rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution.

It's not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London. The new ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue in next year's mayoral election. And if Sadiq khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected.

It's not that measures such as London's Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents' health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits — fewer heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. Fewer untimely deaths.

But mayors and councilors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town. They are acting because national governments — Britain's and others across Europe—have failed to do so.

Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas — city centres, "school streets", even individual roads — are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles into compliance. Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimise pollution. We're doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars.

Now that members of Generation Z are graduating college this spring

the most commonly-accepted definition says this generation was born after 1995, give or take a year—the attention has been rising steadily in recent weeks. Gen Zs are about to hit the streets looking for work in a labor market that's tighter than it's been in decades. And employers are planning on hiring about 17 percent more new graduates for jobs in the U.S. this year than last, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit those empty office cubicles will differ from those who came before them.

If "entitled" is the most con 皿 on adjective, fairly or not, applied to (those born between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation millennials Z are practical and cautious. According to the career counselors and experts who them, Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic pragmatists. Despite study graduating into the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an economic train wreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the crash of 2008, when many of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They aren't interested in taking any chances. The booming economy seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational sense of anxious urgency, especially for those who have college debt. College in the U.S. now stand at a record $1.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

loan balances

One survey from Accenture found that 88 percent of graduating seniors this year chose their major with a job in mind. In a 2019 survey of University of Georgia students, meanwhile, the career office found the most desirable trait in a future employer was the ability to offer secure employment (followed by professional development and training, and then inspiring purpose). Job security or stability was the second most important career goal(work-life balance was number one), followed by a sense of being dedicated to a cause or to feel good about serving the greater good. That's a big change from the previous generation. "Millennials wanted more flexibility in their lives," notes Tanya Michelsen, Associate Director of Y outhSight, a UK-based brand manager that conducts .regular 60-day surveys of British youth, in findings that might just as well apply to American youth. "Generation Zs are looking for more certainty and stability, because of the rise of the gig economy. They have troubles seeing a financial future and they are quite risk averse."

Five Ways to Win Over Everyone in the Office

Is it possible to like everyone in your office? Think about how tough it is to get together 15 people, much less 50, who all get along perfectly. But unlike in friendships, you need coworkers. You work with them every day, and you depend on them just as they depend on you. Here are some ways that you can get the whole office on your side.

If you have a bone to pick with someone in your workplace, you may try to stay tight-lipped around them. But you won't be helping either one of you. A Harvard Business School study found that observers consistently rated those who were upfront about themselves more highly, while those who hid lost trustworthiness. The lesson is not that you should make your personal life an open book, but rather, when given the option to offer up details about yourself or studiously stash them away, you should just be honest.

41.

42.

Just as important as being honest about yourself is being receptive to others. We often feel the need to tell others how we feel, whether it's a concern about a project, a

- 11 -stray thought, or a compliment. Those are all valid, but you need to take time to hear out your coworkers, too. In fact, rushing to get your own ideas out there can cause colleagues to feel you don't value their opinions. Do your best to engage coworkers m a genuine, back-and-forth conversation, rather than prioritizing your own thoughts.

43.

44.

45.

It's con 皿 on to have a "cubicle mate" or special confidant in a work setting. But

in addition to those trusted coworkers, you should expand your horizons and find out about all the people around you. Use your lunch and coffee breaks to meet up with colleagues you don't always see. Find out about their lives and interests beyond the job. It requires minimal effort and goes a long way. This will help to grow your internal network, in addition to being a nice break in the work day.

Positive feedback is important for anyone to hear. And you don't have to be someone's boss to tell them they did an exceptional job on a particular project. This

will help engender good will in others. But don't overdo it or be fake about it. One

study found that people responded best to comments that shifted from negative to

positive, possibly because it suggested they had won somebody over.

This one may be a bit more difficult to pull off, but it can go a long way to achieving results. Remember in dealing with any coworker what they appreciate from an

interaction. Watch out for how they verbalize with others. Some people like small talk in a meeting before digging into important matters, while others are more

straightforward. Jokes that work on one person won't necessarily land with another. So, adapt your style accordingly to type. Consider the person that you're dealing with in advance and what will get you to your desired outcome.

It's almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure. People who do so probably live so cautiously that they go nowhere. Put simply, they're not really living at all. But, the wonderful thing about failure is that it's entirely up to us to decide how to look at it.

We can choose to see failure as “the end of the world”. Or, we can look at failure as the incredible learning experience that it often is. Every time we fail at something, we can choose to look for the lesson we’re meant to learn. These lessons are very important; they’re how we grow, and how we keep from making that same mistake again. Failures stop us only if we let them.

Failure can also teach us things about ourselves that we would never have learned otherwise. For instance, failure can help you discover how strong a person you are. Failing at something can help you discover your truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.
